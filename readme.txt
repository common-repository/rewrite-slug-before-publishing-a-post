== Description ==

Is a known (SEO) issue that if You save a draft post without title, the post_name or slug is immediately saved with the post id.

Later, when You finish your post and put some title, the slug doesn't change; neither also when your slug preference is %postname%.

So, what if we include the following function to rewrite the slug before publishing the post?


== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `rewrite-slug-before-publishing-a-post` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
